Assessment of the web infrastructure picture from Infrastructure Developed Description
On the Internet. In this version, all SPOFS were removed and every major component (web server, application server, and database server) was moved to separate the GNU/Linux servers. SSL security is not terminated in load balancer and each firewalled server network is also monitored. Details about this infrastructure add firewalls between each server. This protects each server from unwanted and unauthorized users rather than a single server. Problems with this infrastructure high maintenance costs. By moving each of the major components to its own server, more servers will buy up the company's electricity bill along with the introduction of new servers. Some of the company's money would have to be used to buy the servers and pay for electricity consumption needed to maintain the servers (including new, old ones).
